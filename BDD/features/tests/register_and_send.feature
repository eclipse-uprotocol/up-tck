Feature: Default
Scenario Outline: To test the registerlistener and send apis
    Given “<uE1>” creates data for "registerlistener"
      And sets "uri.entity.name" to "body.access"
      And sets "uri.resource.name" to "door"
      And sets "uri.resource.instance" to "front_left"
      And sets "uri.resource.message" to "Door"
      And sends "registerlistener" request
      And the status for "registerlistener" request is "OK"

    When “<uE2>” creates data for "send"
      And sets "uri.entity.name" to "body.access"
      And sets "uri.resource.name" to "door"
      And sets "uri.resource.instance" to "front_left"
      And sets "uri.resource.message" to "Door"
      And sets "attributes.priority" to "UPRIORITY_CS1"
      And sets "attributes.type" to "UMESSAGE_TYPE_PUBLISH"
      And sets "attributes.id" to "12345"
      And sets "payload.format" to "protobuf"
      And sets "payload.value" to "serialized protobuf data"
      And sends "send" request
      And the status for "send" request is "OK"

    Then "<uE1>" receives "payload.value" as "serialized protobuf data"
