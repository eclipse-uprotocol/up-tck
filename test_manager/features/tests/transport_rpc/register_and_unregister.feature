Feature: Testing register and unregister

  Scenario Outline: To test the registerlistener and unregisterlistener apis
    Given "<uE1>" creates data for "registerlistener"
    And sets "entity.name" to "body.access"
    And sets "resource.name" to "door"
    And sets "resource.instance" to "front_left"
    And sets "resource.message" to "Door"
    When sends "registerlistener" request

    Then the status received with "code" is "OK"

    When "<uE1>" creates data for "unregisterlistener"
    And sets "entity.name" to "body.access"
    And sets "resource.name" to "door"
    And sets "resource.instance" to "front_left"
    And sets "resource.message" to "Door"
    And sends "unregisterlistener" request

    Then the status received with "code" is "OK"

    Examples:
      | uE1    |
      | java   |
      | python |


    Scenario Outline: Test unregisterlistener when no entity is registered to any topic
      Given "<uE1>" creates data for "unregisterlistener"
        And sets "entity.name" to "body.access"
        And sets "resource.name" to "door"
        And sets "resource.instance" to "front_left"
        And sets "resource.message" to "Door"

      When sends "unregisterlistener" request

      Then the status received with "code" is "NOT_FOUND"

        | python |
