Feature: Testing Publishing and Subscribing Across the Streamer

Scenario Outline: To test one uE Subscribing and one uE Publishing

    Given "uE1" creates data for "registerlistener"
    And sets "authority_name" to "linux"
    And sets "ue_id" to "12345"
    And sets "ue_version_major" to "1"
    And sets "resource_id" to "32769"

    When sends "registerlistener" request
    Then the status received with "code" is "OK"

    When "uE2" creates data for "send"
    And sets "attributes.id.msb" to "112128268635242497"
    And sets "attributes.id.lsb" to "11155833020022798372"
    And sets "attributes.source.authority_name" to "linux"
    And sets "attributes.source.ue_id" to "12345"
    And sets "attributes.source.ue_version_major" to "1"
    And sets "attributes.source.resource_id" to "32769"
    And sets "attributes.priority" to "UPRIORITY_CS1"
    And sets "attributes.type" to "UMESSAGE_TYPE_PUBLISH"
    And sets "attributes.commstatus" to "OK"
    And sets "attributes.traceparent" to "traceparentTest"
    And sets "payload" to b".type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Int32Value\x12\x02\x08\x03"

    And sends "send" request

    Then the status received with "code" is "OK"
    And "uE1" sends onreceive message with field "payload" as b"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Int32Value\x12\x02\x08\x03"

    # Unregister in the end for cleanup
    When "uE1" creates data for "unregisterlistener"
    And sets "authority_name" to "linux"
    And sets "ue_id" to "12345"
    And sets "ue_version_major" to "1"
    And sets "resource_id" to "32769"
    And sends "unregisterlistener" request

    Then the status received with "code" is "OK"
