Feature: Testing Notifiaction Sink and Source Functionality

  Scenario Outline: To test the notification sink and source apis
    Given "uE1" creates data for "notificationsink"
    And sets to entity URI of "uE2" with updated "resource_id" to "32770"
    
    And sends "notificationsink" request
    Then the status received with "code" is "OK"

    When "uE2" creates data for "notificationsource"
    And sets "attributes.source" to entity URI of "uE2" with updated "resource_id" to "32770"
    And sets "attributes.sink" to entity URI of "uE1"
    And sets "attributes.payload_format" to "UPAYLOAD_FORMAT_PROTOBUF_WRAPPED_IN_ANY"
    And sets "payload" to b".type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Int32Value\x12\x02\x08\x03"
    And sends "notificationsource" request

    Then the status received with "code" is "OK"
      And "uE1" sends onreceive message with field "payload" as b"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Int32Value\x12\x02\x08\x03"
