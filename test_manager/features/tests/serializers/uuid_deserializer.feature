Feature: UUID de-serialization

  Scenario Outline: Testing the long uuid deserializer
    Given "<uE1>" creates data for "uuid_deserialize"
    When sends a "uuid_deserialize" request with serialized input "<serialized_uuid>"
    Then the deserialized uuid received should have the following properties:
      | Field | Value |
      | lsb   | <lsb> |
      | msb   | <msb> |

    Examples:
      | uE1    | lsb                  | msb                | serialized_uuid                      |
